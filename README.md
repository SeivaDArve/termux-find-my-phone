# Title: termux-find-my-phone

## Description
By installing Termux (terminal emulator for Android and iPhone) and by insyalling it's API (Termux API) we can ask remotly to the shell to give us the phone's current GPS location... Do you have like me a spare phone at home still with the GPS functionality working? If so, place it inside your car and use this app at your main smartphone to ask the spare phone for the GPS coordinate (no more forgeting your car's location and no more stolen cars)
